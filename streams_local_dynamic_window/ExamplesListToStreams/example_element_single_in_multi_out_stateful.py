"""This module contains examples of stream_func where f_type
is 'element' and stream_func has a list of multiple input streams,
a single output stream, and the operation is stateless. These
examples must have a LIST of input streams and not a single
input stream.

The functions on static Python data structures are of the form:
    list -> element
